# Climate Analysis and Exploration
I decided to take a trip to Hawaii and wanted to do some basic climate analysis and data exploration using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

I used SQLAlchemy to connecto to my sqlite database.

I used SQLAlchemy to reflect my tables into classes.

I was able to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data and plot that data using Matplotlib.

List of active stations and observation counts in descending order:
[('USC00519281', 2772),
 ('USC00519397', 2724),
 ('USC00513117', 2709),
 ('USC00519523', 2669),
 ('USC00516128', 2612),
 ('USC00514830', 2202),
 ('USC00511918', 1979),
 ('USC00517948', 1372),
 ('USC00518838', 511)]
